### (Favorite Quote About Learning)
> “Our world, with its rules of causality, has trained us to be miserly with forgiveness. By forgiving too readily, we can be badly hurt. But if we've learned from a mistake and become better for it, shouldn't we be rewarded for the learning, rather than punished for the mistake?” - Johnathan Blow

### My Interests:
- :computer: Software Development
- :video_game: Game Development
